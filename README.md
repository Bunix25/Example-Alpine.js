## Example 1: x-show / x-if

### Description

In this example, we explore the usage of Alpine.js directives `x-show` and `x-if` to conditionally show or hide elements based on certain conditions.

- Example 1: Demonstrates the usage of `x-show` to hide or show elements.
- Example 2: Demonstrates the usage of `x-if` to show or hide elements, where elements are completely removed from the DOM when hidden.
- Example 3: Shows how to count characters in an input field and display the remaining characters.

### Usage

To run these examples, open the HTML file in a web browser, and you can interact with the elements as described in each example's section.

## Example 2: X-ON (@click etc.)

### Description

This example explores Alpine.js shorthand syntax `@` for event handling (`x-on`). It demonstrates various event-driven interactions using `@click`, `@mouseenter`, and `@keyup`. The examples include:

- Example 1: Resetting the value of an input field on button click.
- Example 2: Showing a submenu on mouse enter and hiding it on a click outside.
- Example 3: Counting characters in an input field and displaying the remaining character count.

### Usage

To run these examples, open the HTML file in a web browser. You can interact with the elements and observe the event-driven behaviors as described in each example's section.
